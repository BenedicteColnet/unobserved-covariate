## Outcome and treatment for CRASH3

Note that the regular outcome is the 28-day death due to brain injury (and not all deaths), but here we take another outcome being Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Therefore, we only keep patients who survived as this indicator assess the disability at the end.

The DRS has to be computed from several indicators.

A missing value in the outcome corresponds usually to death, except for some individuals have missing values in DRS and no death reported, they are removed.

```{r}

#   # if all individuals are kept, impute a value for death
#   CRASH3$Y <- ifelse(is.na(CRASH3$Y), 30, CRASH3$Y)
# } else {
#   CRASH3 <- CRASH3[!is.na(CRASH3$Y),]
# }

# impute value for death
CRASH3$Y <- ifelse(is.na(CRASH3$Y), 30, CRASH3$Y)
```

print(paste0("Remaining observations in CRASH3 from patient who survived: ", nrow(CRASH3)))

# Treatment as a binary variable
CRASH3$A <- ifelse(CRASH3$treatment == "Placebo", 0, 1)

## Load Traumabase

```


## Common set of covariates

### Covariates accounting for patient inclusion into CRASH-3 trial

#### Extra-cranial bleeding

In CRASH3, one of the eligibility criteria is no major extra-cranial bleeding. 
The feature is called "majorExtracranial" in the CRASH3 trial with a Yes/No answer. We binarize this data with Yes corresponding to 1, and No to 0 (this is the standard proceadure we apply all along this part for binary covariate).

The equivalent variable in the Traumabase is chosen based on *CGR.6h > 3* or if variable *colloides* ou *cristallides* > 0 (corresponding to a major extracranial bleeding). These conditions determining presence or absence of an major extracranial bleeding have been decided with the Traumbase doctors.

#### Age

Only adults are said to be eligible in CRASH3, but we observe that children are included.
We record `r nrow(CRASH3[CRASH3$age < 18 & !is.na(CRASH3$age),])` values with age lower than 18 years. Some of them are eligible, others are not. Note that we also record `r nrow(CRASH3[!is.na(CRASH3$age),])` observations with missing data in the age column.  

#### TBI

The Traumabase contains this feature, we just rename it and binarize it (1 for TBI, and 0 for no TBI).
In the CRASH3 trial we made it correspond with intraCranialbleeding feature which as Yes, No and, No CT scan available. 
To conclude on an intracranial bleeding with no CT scan, we consider there is a TBI since the patient is said to be eligible in CRASH3. 

#### GSC

The Traumabase contains the *Glasgow.initial* covariate (a discrete, range: [3, 15]), and corresponds to Initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on arrival on scene of enhanced care team and on arrival at the hospital (GCS = 3: deep coma; GCS = 15: conscious and alert).
In CRASH 3 data it corresponds to 3 variables that have to be summed. 
It is also important to note that some Glasgow score are taken after intubation, so not initially. As only one GSC values is mentioned per observation, we keep all the values and consider it initial value.


### Other covariates

In this part we also include other covariates that are in the baseline (so that probably have an impact on the treatment effect and the outcome), and other "easy" covariates to map. We include systolic blood pressure, sex, and also pupils reactivity.


```{r}
# major extracranial
CRASH3$majorExtracranial <- ifelse(CRASH3$majorExtracranial == "Yes", 1, 0) 

# TBI (1 for TBI, 0 if not TBI)
CRASH3$TBI <- ifelse(CRASH3$intraCranialBleeding == "Yes" | (CRASH3$intraCranialBleeding == "No CT scan available" & CRASH3$eligible == "Yes"), 1, 0)

# GSC
CRASH3$Glasgow.initial <- as.numeric(substring(CRASH3$gcsEyeOpening, 1, 1)) + 
                                 as.numeric(substring(CRASH3$gcsMotorResponse, 1, 1)) +
                                 as.numeric(substring(CRASH3$gcsVerbalResponse, 1, 1))
 
# Women (1) and men (0)
CRASH3$sexe <- ifelse(CRASH3$sex == "Female", 1, 0)

# Pupil reactivity
CRASH3$pupilReact_num <- case_when(CRASH3$pupilReact == "Both React" ~ 2,
                                           CRASH3$pupilReact == "One Reacts" ~ 1,
                                           CRASH3$pupilReact == "None React" ~ 0,
                                           CRASH3$pupilReact == "Unable to assess" ~ -1) 


# a few patients have no TBI in CRASH-3, to compare similar quantity we exclude them
CRASH3_tbionly <- CRASH3[CRASH3$TBI == 1,]
```


Note that in CRASH3, first patient could be treated in a 8h window after injury, and then finally 3h. In the final data frame we only keep these patients.

In CRASH-3 it corresponds to timeSinceInjury in hours. In France recommandations for doctors already state to use the tranexamic acid as soon as possible, and in a 3h window after injury.


```{r}
# Time between injury and treatment
## data treatement from string to numeric hours and minutes
CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_h = format(as.POSIXct(CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), format="%H")
CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_h <- as.numeric(CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_h)
CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_m = format(as.POSIXct(CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), format="%M")
CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_m <- as.numeric(CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_m)
CRASH3_tbionly$time_to_treatment <- CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_h*60 + CRASH3_tbionly$timeSinceInjury_m
```



```{r}
ggplot(CRASH3_tbionly, aes(x = time_to_treatment)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, fill = "blue", color = "darkblue", alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 60*3, size = 1.5) +
  xlab("Time to treatment (min)") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("CRASH3")
```

We keep only patients eligible.

```{r}
# keep only people treated on time in CRASH3
CRASH3_tbionly <- CRASH3_tbionly[CRASH3_tbionly$time_to_treatment <= 60*3,]
```

Finally, keep only traumabase patient with no major extracranial bleeding.

```{r}
imputed_traumabase <- imputed_traumabase[imputed_traumabase$majorExtracranial == 0,]
```




```{r}
# indicator for RCT and RWD
CRASH3_tbionly$S <- rep(1, nrow(CRASH3_tbionly))

observed.covariates <- c("age", "Glasgow.initial", 'systolicBloodPressure', "sexe", "pupilReact_num")
covariates <- c(observed.covariates, "time_to_treatment")

CRASH3_tbionly <- CRASH3_tbionly[, c(covariates, "Y", "A", "S")]
print(nrow(CRASH3_tbionly))
CRASH3_tbionly <- na.omit(CRASH3_tbionly)
print(nrow(CRASH3_tbionly))

# total data frame
total <- rbind(CRASH3_tbionly,
               imputed_traumabase[, c(covariates, "Y", "A", "S")])

rownames(total) <- 1:nrow(total)
```


```{r}
colnames(total)[which(names(total) == "systolicBloodPressure")] <- "blood"
colnames(total)[which(names(total) == "pupilReact_num")] <- "pupil"
colnames(total)[which(names(total) == "Glasgow.initial")] <- "glasgow"

observed.covariates <- c("age", "glasgow", 'blood', "sexe", "pupil")
covariates <- c(observed.covariates, "time_to_treatment")
```


```{r}
# keep only the mild and moderate patient
if (!KEEP_ALL_INDIVIDUALS){
  print(nrow(total))
  total <- total[which((total$S == 1 & total$glasgow > 8 & total$Y < 30) | (total$S == 0 & total$glasgow > 8)),]
  print(nrow(total))
}
```

```{r}
table(total$S)
```


# Analysis

## CRASH-3 analysis

```{r}
t.test(total[total$S ==1 & total$A == 1, "Y"], total[total$S ==1 & total$A == 0, "Y"])
```
We can conclude on no treatment effect.

Note that the time to treatment seems to be important.

```{r}
t.test(total[total$S ==1 & total$A == 1 & total$time_to_treatment < 30, "Y"], total[total$S ==1 & total$A == 0 & total$time_to_treatment < 30, "Y"])
```

```{r}
t.test(total[total$S ==1 & total$A == 1 & total$time_to_treatment > 30, "Y"], total[total$S ==1 & total$A == 0 & total$time_to_treatment > 30, "Y"])
```

## Assumptions

```{r}
cor(total[total$S == 1, covariates])
cor(total[total$S == 0, observed.covariates])
```

We observe correlations in between age and systolic blood pressure, and pupil reaction with the Glasgow score, which is coherent.


```{r}
covEllipses(total[, c("age", "blood", "glasgow", "pupil")],
            group = total$S,  
            variables=1:4, 
            fill.alpha=.1,
            center = TRUE,
            pooled = FALSE)
```

A statistical test would largely reject assumption 8.

```{r}
boxM(total[, observed.covariates], group = total$S)
boxM(total[,  c("age", "blood", "glasgow", "pupil")], group = total$S)
```

Then, we make the approximation that the time to treatment is independent with all other variables.
